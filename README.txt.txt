Questions

1. Which guideline or principle did you find interesting?
As someone who uses Apple Car Play to use Google Maps on my car extremely often, I found
the keeping UI elements consistent Visual Principle to be, if not the most interesting, the most helpful
and useful. As I am driving, I can completely minimize my visual attention to instruments not
used for driving and can operate them at touch like a keyboard. That is development that I find the 
most comforting when I have adjusting things that are not completely pertained to driving.

2. Which guideline or principle do you think is not important or needs further explanation?
While most of these guidelines and principles make sense, in the Layout section of the Visual design and
user interaction section, it seems to me that there is a blanket ban on all scrolling text.
While I can understand the goal of minimizing moving objects on the screen, I believe it could 
conflict with the idea of minimizing having the user to operate the screen with their hand. 
Overall, I could see how it gives the user the ability to set the pace of the interaction, however I could
see some cases where some scrolling text could be acceptable.

3. Good idea or bad idea: An app that notifies the driver about their next upcoming appointment.
Seeing that Apple already does this to me with the Calendar app and Apple Car play, it could be a good idea.
I don't spent much time using it, but the small reminders of where the location is and when the event
takes place could be a good quick reminder for a driver w/o the driver having to look at their phone.

4. Good idea or bad idea: A music player that has buttons much larger than the song information.
I would go with a good idea, where the user could quickly pause, skip or replay a song. This could
encorage the user to not spend a lot of time reading the song information while they should be driving.
Also, it allows the user to quickly interact with the screen and then return their information to the road.
